description: "The Last Days of Pompeii is a novel written by the baron Edward Bulwer-Lytton\
  \ in 1834. The novel was inspired by the painting The Last Day of Pompeii by the\
  \ Russian painter Karl Briullov, which Bulwer-Lytton had seen in Milan. It culminates\
  \ in the cataclysmic destruction of the city of Pompeii by the eruption of Mount\
  \ Vesuvius in AD 79.\nThe novel uses its characters to contrast the decadent culture\
  \ of 1st-century Rome with both older cultures and coming trends. The protagonist,\
  \ Glaucus, represents the Greeks who have been subordinated by Rome, and his nemesis\
  \ Arbaces the still older culture of Egypt. Olinthus is the chief representative\
  \ of the nascent Christian religion, which is presented favourably but not uncritically.\
  \ The Witch of Vesuvius, though she has no supernatural powers, shows Bulwer-Lytton's\
  \ interest in the occult â€“ a theme which would emerge in his later writing, particularly\
  \ The Coming Race.\nA popular sculpture by American sculptor Randolph Rogers, Nydia,\
  \ the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii (1856), was based on a character from the book.\n\
